Welcome to another episode of the \"Chai Time Data Science\" show. In this episode, I interview Shivam Bansal, who is one of the top kernel Grand Masters on Kaggle currently ranked fourth in the kernel rankings. Shivam is currently working as a research scientist at NUS and he has been working in the data science field for the past few years. We talk about his journey into data science, his Kaggle experience and about his recent competitions solution to the competition that he's recently won. We also talk about his pipeline for writing the amazing kernels, and blogposts that I'm definitely a fan of. Without further ado, enjoy the show.\\n\\nSanyam Bhutani  1:44  \\nHello, Grand Master, thank you so much...</td>\n",

       "0  Hey, this is Sanyam Bhutani and you're listening to \"Chai Time Data Science\", a podcast for data science enthusiast where I interview practitioners, researchers, and Kagglers about their journey, experience, and talk all things about data science.\\n\\nSanyam Bhutani  0:46  \\nHi, everyone. Welcome to another episode of the \"Chai Time Data Science\" show. In this episode, I interview Shivam Bansal, who is one of the top kernel Grand Masters on Kaggle currently ranked fourth in the kernel rankings. Shivam is currently working as a research scientist at NUS and he has been working in the data science field for the past few years. We talk about his journey into data science, his Kaggle experience and about his recent competitions solution to the competition that he's recently won. We also talk about his pipeline for writing the amazing kernels, and blogposts that I'm definitely a fan of. Without further ado, enjoy the show.\\n\\nSanyam Bhutani  1:44  \\nHello, Grand Master, thank you so much...  \n",

But at some point is started getting boring because you know, at some point, you will only start to do maintenance stuff. And everything start to get boring, basically. And so it got repetitive and very repetitive. Yeah. Because you only you're, you're only fixing bugs and, and maintaining stuff, basically. So at that point, I started to look for new opportunities. And the moment where I started to look for zero opportunities was exactly at the moment where deep learning started to boom. And I didn't know about that at all.
